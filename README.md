Created an Android Viewsâ€“based Profile Card app named Mason_Lab6 that displays a circular profile picture, my name, and a short bio centered on a lavender background using XML layouts, an ImageView with a circle-mask drawable, and TextViews. The UI is implemented entirely with classic Android Views and styled with an AppCompat NoActionBar theme. To run it, open the project in Android Studio and click Run to install and launch the app on an emulator or connected device.
